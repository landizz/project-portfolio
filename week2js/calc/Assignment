Project 1: Calculator

Objective: Build a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

Key Concepts:

    DOM manipulation for buttons and display.
    Event handling for clicking buttons and displaying results.
    Handling edge cases (e.g., dividing by zero).

Challenges:

    Store inputs and display the result dynamically.
    Implement a clear button to reset the calculation.
    Consider handling floating-point numbers and multiple operations.
