Thank you for providing the JavaScript code! I'll provide feedback based on your code and the overall logic you've implemented.
Overall Code Review:
Strengths:

    Clear Structure:
        Your calculator is well-structured, with clear separation of DOM manipulation and business logic.
        The use of event listeners for button presses is implemented effectively, and your form interaction is smooth.

    Regex for Parsing:
        The use of regex to tokenize the user input is a smart approach. You correctly identify numbers, operators, and parentheses using a single regex pattern (parser_regex).

    Modular Logic:
        You've broken down the evaluation into three clear levels:
            Level 1: Handles parentheses.
            Level 2: Handles multiplication and division.
            Level 3: Handles addition and subtraction.

    Recursion:
        Your recursive approach for parentheses evaluation is a strong choice. When the code encounters parentheses, it correctly calls mainEval() recursively.

Areas for Improvement:

    Handling Nested Parentheses:
        While you’ve implemented basic parentheses evaluation, the issue with nested parentheses still exists. This occurs because you're not fully capturing nested expressions. You might want to ensure that the inner parentheses are evaluated first before moving to the outer parentheses. The recursion is close, but it needs refinement to handle cases like 3 * (2 + (4 / 2)).

    Re-evaluating After Splicing:
        You’re correctly using splice() to replace parts of the array after evaluation, but sometimes, after splicing, the program moves on without re-evaluating the same index. For example, after you handle * or /, the next operator might not get evaluated if the array size has changed due to splicing. In some cases, resetting or adjusting the index (x) after splicing would ensure continuous evaluation.
        You also perform a recursive call inside the loop in level3Eval (level3Eval(evaluation)), but this can sometimes lead to re-evaluating parts unnecessarily or missing parts if the array changes. Iteration should be preferred to ensure sequential operation.

    Edge Case Handling:
        Division by zero: You might want to add a check to prevent division by zero from occurring. You could handle this by returning an error message or something user-friendly like "Error" or "Infinity".

    Input Validation:
        You could consider adding validation for edge cases like:
            Multiple consecutive operators (e.g., ++ or */).
            Incomplete expressions (e.g., starting or ending with an operator).
            Unmatched parentheses (e.g., 3 * (4 + 2).

Suggestions for Fixing Nested Parentheses:

    Reset the Index after evaluating a pair of parentheses. Right now, once you handle a closing parenthesis ), you should reset x to 0 or continue evaluating from the start to ensure the entire expression is fully re-evaluated.

    Stack Approach for Parentheses: Instead of the recursive approach, consider using a stack to keep track of opening and closing parentheses. When you encounter a closing parenthesis, evaluate the expression inside the stack, then continue with the rest of the expression.

Next Steps:

    Fixing Nested Parentheses: Refine your recursive logic or try a stack-based approach to ensure that nested expressions are evaluated correctly.
    Adjust Splicing Logic: Ensure that after using splice() in level2Eval and level3Eval, the evaluation continues correctly. This might involve resetting the index after an operation or re-evaluating the array from the start.
    Edge Cases: Handle cases like division by zero and input validation.

Overall Grade: A-

    Why: Your project demonstrates strong understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and recursive logic. The missing nested parentheses feature and minor edge case handling are the only things keeping it from a perfect score.

With a bit more refinement in handling parentheses and input validation, your project will be in excellent shape.

Let me know if you'd like more guidance on these refinements!
