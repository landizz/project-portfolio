I’ve reviewed your Week 2 project. Here's the feedback based on the requirements:
Strengths:

    Functionality:
        You successfully implemented the core functionality of adding and removing tasks from the list. Your use of document.createElement and addEventListener demonstrates a good grasp of DOM manipulation.

    Code Structure:
        The code is well-organized and easy to follow.
        The removal feature works as expected, with each button dynamically removing its corresponding task.

    Use of Event Listeners:
        Correct usage of event listeners for both the "Add" button and dynamically created "Remove" buttons. This shows an understanding of how to handle events in a dynamic web page.

Areas for Improvement:

    Input Validation:
        Currently, the user can add empty tasks. You could improve this by validating the input so that empty or whitespace-only tasks cannot be added to the list. Example:

        javascript

    if (UserTask.trim() === "") {
        return; // Prevents adding an empty task
    }

User Feedback:

    It would be nice to clear the input field after a task is added, providing better UX. This can be done with:

    javascript

        document.getElementById("userInput").value = "";

    Accessibility:
        You could add more focus on accessibility by including descriptive aria-labels for the buttons or ensuring that keyboard navigation works smoothly (e.g., pressing "Enter" adds the task).

Grade: A-

You’ve demonstrated a solid understanding of JavaScript basics and DOM manipulation. Adding validation and minor UX improvements would take this to an even higher level.

Great job! Let me know if you'd like further guidance on any improvements!
