        <p>My name is Jonas, I am a 30 (born 1994) year old construction worker. Even though I work in construction I have, atleast what I would like to think, an extensive IT background.</p>
        <p>It all started when I was about 14 years old. I was considering buying a Playstation 3. My father however suggested that I buy a computer instead.</p>
        <p>Thank god for that suggestions as that led to me getting a heading, a goal in life. Atleast for a few years.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I started like most, playing games. But found myself curious in the many technical things that was possible. Even when I was younger and used the schools computers, I remember creating .bat scripts doing some basic things as changing colors our what not.</p>
        <p>I touched on a lot of different aspects, HTML, CSS, C++, hardware, software etc...</p>
        <br>
        <p>I got into a school that specialized in computer science and in my second year I got to choose my specialization.</p>
        <p>I chose networking and jumped head first into a magical world. I found this subject extremely interesting.</p>
        <p>This subject explained how it was possible for me to enjoy all the things I had with computers.</p>
        <p>It explained how I was able to play counter-strike 1.5 in a internet-less cafe in the early 2000's with random people next to me.</p>
        <p>It explained how I was able to talk with people in different countries while raiding Ragnaros in World of Warcraft.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I quickly gained knowledge and decided early on to expand my studies further, deeper. So I applied to the university.</p>
        <p>Högskolan Väst was the school and network technologies with IT-Security was the subject. This is where it all went downhill...</p>
        <br>
        <p>To make a long story long but still short, I had problems. Not so much with the studies, even though they got affected.</p>
        <p>I had different problems, which led to the last 2 courses in my final semester not being passed.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I tried the next year, but no it was not possible. Here my life took a pause for about 5 years, in these 5 years I stood still.</p>
        <p>Meaning, I did not progress in any studies, any physical activity or social.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, eventually just like Bilbo and the company of Thorin I managed to get out of the dark forest.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Since then I've been working in construction. 5 years in construction and I feel that it is time, it is time again to make the long hike that is IT.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm still not 100% sure in what direction I will go, or what tools, technologies I will study or progress in. But I am here, I am exploring, I am hiking..</p>
        <br><br>

        <p>PS. I know I basically have not given any information about likes or dislikes etc.. but I feel like that is irrelevant at this point, tal vez en el futuro.</p>
